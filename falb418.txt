This dashboard uses a design which is minimal and unobtrusive. A simple
black-on-white colorscheme with some gray tones are used, with divisions added 
to help break up the page. The page is also fully responsive using a few media
queries as well as ResizeObservers to redraw the charts to best-fit the available
space. The charts also contain a minimal amount of interactivity - clients can 
hover over bars to see their label and value.

The development process involved setting up a base project using the design I
used for the previous assignments, and from there adding the application-specific
features. The previous assignments were a big help in completing this one -
specifically, the assignment on SVGs and the content of Quiz 2 were very relevant.

Building charts without the use of libraries is more challenging than expected, 
and a particular development challenge faced was the getting the axis labels to
not overlap. A solution I developed was to approximate the length of the axis
labels and use that to space them out. The result is that not all labels are shown,
but a little interactivity (hover to see label and value) helped to alleviate this.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the assignments so far and feel more confident in
in building web applications to solve problems I may have.
