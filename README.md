# COMPSCI-335-Reflection

A reflection on everything that was taught in the first half of COMPSCI 335 at UoA. Very interesting overall, this assignment involved (to a degree) building a small charting library from scratch. Overall, the first half of this course showed me that a lot can be done without using any frameworks or dependencies, while, on the other hand, it also made me appreciate using third party dependencies a lot more - the time savings if I'd used something like [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) are apparent.

## Specifications:

* Construct a single-page dynamic web application
* Consume a third party web API
* Create infographics using SVG elements
* No third party dependencies
